# Burger App
Node, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize

# Overview
Sequelized Burger App is a burger logger utilizing Node, Express, Handlebars, and the Sequelize ORM. Following the MVC design pattern, Node and Sequelize will route data while Handlebars generates HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page with a 'Devour It' button.

When the user clicks the 'Devour It' button, the burger will move to the right side of the page and a delete button 'X' will appear. If the user chooses to click the delete button, that burger will be removed from the database.

Enjoy!
